      Green Reuse Exchange is a community-driven platform dedicated to reducing waste and promoting sustainability by enabling users to exchange reusable items. Our mission is to build a greener future by connecting people who want to give away items they no longer need with those who can use them.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Users can browse available items, post their own reusable goods, and claim items from others. The platform supports a variety of categories including books, clothing, electronics, and furniture. By facilitating easy and secure exchanges, we help extend the life cycle of products and foster a culture of sharing and environmental responsibility.
    </p>

      Join us in making a positive impact on our environment and community. Every item exchanged is a step towards a more sustainable world!
